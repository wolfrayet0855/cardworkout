Timer Management
func startTimer()
Schedules a timer to call the showRandomImage method every 0.1 seconds, updating the workout card image.
@objc func showRandomImage()
Updates the cardimageView with a random card image from the cards array.
Uses a placeholder image ("AS") if the cards array is empty.
Button Actions
